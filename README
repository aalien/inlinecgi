What?
    Inlinecgi searches files for <? and ?> tags. Then it cuts the script in
    between and executes it with /bin/sh.

How?
    Just ./inlinecgi FILE. There's also a tiny cgi-bin ready script for use in
    web pages, that will give the http query string (the part after the "?") to
    the actual inlinecgi binary as a parameter.

Why?
    Because Fruide (http://cappu.shelli.fi/fruide_ideas.html) seemed like it
    would take too long to become usable, and I wanted something else than just
    another scripting language.

Who?
